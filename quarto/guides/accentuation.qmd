# Accentuation



Overview:  two exported functions allows you to remove accents from a string, or add accent to a "word" (a single lexical token).  Words may be accented either with recessive accent, or with persistent accent in the penult, indicated with a second parameter which should be either the symbol `:RECESSIVE` or `:PENULT`.  

:::{.callout-note}
Words cannot be accented on the ultima based on orthography alone; that requires further knowledge of the morphological form of the word.
:::

```{julia}
using PolytonicGreek 
lg = literaryGreek()
rmaccents("πολλά", lg)

# output
#"πολλα"
```

```{julia}
accentword("ἀνθρωπος", :RECESSIVE, lg)

# output
#"ἄνθρωπος"
```
